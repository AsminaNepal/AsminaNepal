     <p>Coding is a method of <strong>communicating</strong> with a computer. </p>
     <p>Coding is used for writing <em>systematic</em> lines of instructions
        that will perform certain actions. </p>
     <p>Coding uses computer <strong>programming</strong> languages to give computers and machines a set 
         of instructions to perform tasks.</p>
     <p>The programming language opens several <strong>opportunities</strong> for new programmers, 
         allowing them to make it big in the world of app development. </p>
     <p>Working with code <strong>has been generally</strong>  easier.</p>
